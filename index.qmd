Over the last 10 years I’ve worked on building [ML-based solutions for chemical synthesis](https://github.com/MolecularAI/aizynthfinder), [systems for automatic activity recognition](https://research.ibm.com/projects/lab-that-learns), and [LLM's for text2sql](https://research.ibm.com/projects/flowpilot).

This has changed how [medicines](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/md/d3md00651d) and [agrochemicals](https://shootsbysyngenta.com/success-story-ibm-and-syngenta) are made across large organisations.

#### Now, I'm looking for a new adventure.

If you’re in the early stages of working on a problem, and need a proactive partner willing to take on challenges across building, management, and working with clients, [i'd love to chat](https://calendar.notion.so/meet/amolthakkar/9v1jp4lmt).


#### Currently
Hitting reset, embracing my curiosity, and reinvigorating my inner child.

- Cycled from Zurich to Istanbul
- Learning Norwegian -- Exploring new ways to learn, teach, and build with AI
- Advising a small business on digital strategy

<!-- I'm passionate about building 

Now, I’m looking to bring it all together and build on my experience to tackle the next problem. -->
