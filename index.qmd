# Hi, I’m Amol.

I am a **Research-to-Product Technologist** working at the intersection of AI, product, and real-world deployment. I specialize in taking advanced research from the lab and turning it into scalable, production-grade systems.

Currently, I’m an **Applied AI Scientist at the [Ellison Institute of Technology (EIT), Oxford](https://www.eit.org/)**. My career has been defined by a "bench-to-bits" trajectory. Starting in physical lab science and evolving into software engineering and AI research at institutions like **IBM Research**, **AstraZeneca**, and **Pfizer**.

### What I Build
I thrive in high-growth, ambiguous environments where technical and product decisions are tightly coupled. Over the past decade, I have focused on building AI that survives contact with reality:

* **ML-Driven Organic Synthesis:** Delivered [AiZynthFinder](https://github.com/MolecularAI/aizynthfinder), an open-source platform that influenced [how medicines are made at AstraZeneca](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/md/d3md00651d), and [IBM RXN](https://github.com/rxn4chemistry) which impacted [how agrochemicals are developed at Syngenta](https://shootsbysyngenta.com/success-story-ibm-and-syngenta).
* **Applied LLMs:** Developed and trained [LLMs for text-to-SQL](https://research.ibm.com/projects/flowpilot) to bridge the gap between natural language and complex data architectures.
* **Computer Vision & IoT:** Built [automatic activity recognition](https://research.ibm.com/projects/lab-that-learns) systems to digitize real-world laboratory and operational workflows.

### My Approach
My strength lies in **translation**. I bridge the gap between research, engineering, and user needs. I have led small teams, driven internal initiatives, and owned client-facing engagements across pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and finance. 

I’m most engaged when I can own the full lifecycle. From the first line of research code to the design, deployment, and productionisation of a system. 

**I am interested in roles and collaborations where building, scaling, and high-velocity impact matter.**

### Beyond the Lab
When I’m not building systems, I’m usually pushing my physical limits in the mountains or the water. My background in endurance and alpine sports includes:

* **Cycling & Swimming:** Cycled solo from **Zurich to Istanbul**, completed a **Half Ironman**, and finished a **10km marathon swim**.
* **Alpinism:** Active in **ski touring, mountaineering, and climbing**, including several alpine summits (not as much anymore, South East England is pretty flat)

I find that the discipline and risk management required for these pursuits mirror the persistence and focus needed to solve high-stakes technical problems.
