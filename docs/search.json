    "text": "Hi, I’m Amol.\nI am a Research-to-Product Technologist working at the intersection of AI, product, and real-world deployment. I specialize in taking advanced research from the lab and turning it into scalable, production-grade systems.\nCurrently, I’m an Applied AI Scientist at the Ellison Institute of Technology (EIT), Oxford. My career has been defined by a “bench-to-bits” trajectory. Starting in physical lab science and evolving into software engineering and AI research at institutions like IBM Research, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer.\n\nWhat I Build\nI thrive in high-growth, ambiguous environments where technical and product decisions are tightly coupled. Over the past decade, I have focused on building AI that survives contact with reality:\n\nML-Driven Organic Synthesis: Delivered AiZynthFinder, an open-source platform that influenced how medicines are made at AstraZeneca, and IBM RXN which impacted how agrochemicals are developed at Syngenta.\nApplied LLMs: Developed and trained LLMs for text-to-SQL to bridge the gap between natural language and complex data architectures.\nComputer Vision & IoT: Built automatic activity recognition systems to digitize real-world laboratory and operational workflows.\n\n\n\nMy Approach\nMy strength lies in translation. I bridge the gap between research, engineering, and user needs. I have led small teams, driven internal initiatives, and owned client-facing engagements across pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and finance.\nI’m most engaged when I can own the full lifecycle. From the first line of research code to the design, deployment, and productionisation of a system.\nI am interested in roles and collaborations where building, scaling, and high-velocity impact matter."
