    "text": "Over the last 10 years I’ve worked on building ML-based solutions for chemical synthesis, systems for automatic activity recognition, and LLM’s for text2sql.\nThis has changed how medicines and agrochemicals are made across large organisations.\n\nExperience and Interests\nMy experience spans the full development lifecycle - from lab-based research to the design, deployment, and productionisation of AI tools for both early-stage discovery and scale-up. I’m particularly interested in translating research into the real world, especially via commercial entities, whether industry or start-ups. I plan on writing some thoughts on the matter so check back for a link later."
